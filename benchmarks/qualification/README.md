# Fixed-resource qualification

Run from the production-suite checkout with Go, Docker Compose and curl installed.
Set `SINK_SERVER_DIR` to the candidate checkout (default `../sink`):

```sh
SINK_SERVER_DIR=/path/to/sink bash benchmarks/qualification/run.sh
```

The runner creates a unique Compose project and loopback ports, builds the
candidate image and load client, and removes its containers, network and data
volume on exit. Evidence retains the rendered configuration, source revision
and patch, image ID, per-case JSON, container metrics and exit codes.

| Component | CPU quota | Memory limit | Memory target |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Gateway | 1 CPU | 256 MiB | GOMEMLIMIT=192 MiB |
| Engine | 1 CPU | 768 MiB | GOMEMLIMIT=512 MiB |
| MongoDB replica-set member | 2 CPUs | 1 GiB | WiredTiger=256 MiB |

Both Go containers use GOMAXPROCS=2 under their 1 CPU quota. Sink's total quota is
2 CPUs / 1 GiB; database and host load-generator resources are additional. This
is a disposable single-node database, not an election qualification. Stop other
load tests when comparing results. Admission byte budgets do not equal RSS.

The matrix measures 1 KiB upserts across 16/32/64/128 concurrent callers,
16-operation batches, merges, mixed reads/writes, Read and Count, 64 KiB returned
documents, and 500 offered RPC/s. Each cell lasts 30 seconds after seeding and
channel warmup, then reconciles persisted data. JSON reports distinguish useful
throughput, failure codes, P50/P95/P99, unissued work and reconciliation.
`healthy=false` is a saturation result; inspect the exit-code file and do not
count failed setup or failed reconciliation as a capacity sample.

For image comparisons under identical budgets:

```sh
SINK_PERF_IMAGE=sink-baseline:local SINK_PERF_BUILD=0 \
SINK_PERF_PROFILE=compare SINK_PERF_REPEATS=3 SINK_PERF_DURATION=30s \
SINK_PERF_ARTIFACTS=/tmp/sink-perf-baseline bash benchmarks/qualification/run.sh

SINK_PERF_IMAGE=sink-candidate:local SINK_PERF_BUILD=0 \
SINK_PERF_PROFILE=compare SINK_PERF_REPEATS=3 SINK_PERF_DURATION=30s \
SINK_PERF_ARTIFACTS=/tmp/sink-perf-candidate bash benchmarks/qualification/run.sh
```

The comparison profile covers single-operation and 16-operation upserts/merges.
The same host client drives both images. Record the prebuilt images' source
revisions separately: `revision.txt` identifies the candidate server checkout. Use multiple
runs; allocator improvements do not establish end-to-end capacity gains, and
closed-loop saturation does not guarantee an open-loop SLO.

Set `SINK_PERF_ENGINE_CONFIG` or `SINK_PERF_GATEWAY_CONFIG` to absolute paths to
compare configuration choices with the same images and container limits. Retain that configuration
with the results; a shorter batching wait can reduce latency while increasing
backend calls, so measure both small RPCs and explicit batches before tuning.
The ordinary Engine fixture inherits the candidate's batch-size default (32
starting with the role-configuration redesign). Historical runs used their
recorded candidate defaults, so preserve an explicit `batching.max_operations`
when isolating a code change from a configuration change.
The provided `engine-low-latency.yaml` changes only the batching wait to 500µs:

```sh
SINK_PERF_ENGINE_CONFIG="$PWD/benchmarks/qualification/engine-low-latency.yaml" \
SINK_PERF_PROFILE=compare bash benchmarks/qualification/run.sh
```

The `read-budgets` profile repeats mixed traffic, batched reads and large returned
documents. The supplied pair lowers `grpc.max_send_message_bytes` from 4 MiB to
1 MiB in both roles, reducing the largest response they can serve. The current
memory allocator charges actual working allocations; the older worst-case
response-reservation results do not apply unchanged. Validate real response
sizes and measure the current candidate before selecting a smaller transport limit:

```sh
SINK_PERF_ENGINE_CONFIG="$PWD/benchmarks/qualification/engine-small-responses.yaml" \
SINK_PERF_GATEWAY_CONFIG="$PWD/benchmarks/qualification/gateway-small-responses.yaml" \
SINK_PERF_PROFILE=read-budgets bash benchmarks/qualification/run.sh
```

Run separate [DNS/drain qualification](https://github.com/batchstream/sink/blob/main/docs/rolling-upgrades.md) and the
public production suite's Kafka/Worker faults. Performance runs inject no faults.

MongoDB test containers set `GLIBC_TUNABLES=glibc.pthread.rseq=1`, matching the
quickstart and storage integration runner. This disables the affected TCMalloc
per-CPU path on kernels with the rseq compatibility problem. Keep this setting
identical for baseline and candidate runs; allocator configuration affects
performance. See the [backend environment requirements](https://github.com/batchstream/sink/blob/main/docs/backend-environment.md).

The `offered` profile schedules 500, 5,000 and 20,000 RPC/s with 32 callers. Use
longer cells (for example, `SINK_PERF_DURATION=60s`) to expose periodic backend
flush and scheduling stalls. Latency includes delay from the intended schedule;
`execution_p99_ms` excludes that scheduling delay, and `scheduled_not_issued`
records offered work that the bounded load generator could not issue. A high
closed-loop rate does not establish a latency SLO at a fixed offered rate.
